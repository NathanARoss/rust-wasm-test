Practice compiling Rust programs into minimal Wasm binaries

I plan to rewrite an existing JS project in WebAssembly, so I need practice maintaining state, passing objects to javascript, and compiling small Wasm binaries.  I also take a look at what the Rust compiler generates for small statements to get a sense of best practices for Wasm code.
